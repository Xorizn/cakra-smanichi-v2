## Original User Request:
Design a modern, responsive e-learning quiz website. The layout should be clean, minimalistic, and user-friendly.

The main quiz interface should have the following features:

    Each question is displayed in a card-style container in the center of the screen.

    Above the question card, include a question navigation bar showing numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc.), allowing users to jump to any question directly by clicking the number. Highlight the current active question.

    Below each question, provide multiple-choice answers with interactive selection (radio buttons or button styles).

    Include Next and Previous buttons for smooth navigation. Disable "Next" if it's the last question and "Previous" if it's the first.

Add a login and registration page with fields for email, password, and a "Remember me" checkbox. The login UI should be clean and professional, with error handling and feedback messages.

Additional features to include:

    A responsive design that works well on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

    A header with the website name and a logout button.

    A result page that shows the final score after the quiz, with feedback (correct/incorrect answers highlighted).

    Smooth animations and transitions for card changes and page navigation.

    Use modern fonts and soft color palettes for a comfortable reading experience.

The UI/UX should feel like a professional learning platform, similar to Coursera or Udemy, but tailored for quizzes., use Nextjs Tailwind, Firebase/Auth for backend login functionality.
